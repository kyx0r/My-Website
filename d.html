This page explains my projects in depth and documents their functionality among with
some personal remarks.<br>
<br>

<span id="VEther" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/VEther">VEther</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Probably one of the most complex projects on my side. <br />
An attempt to write 3d game engine from scratch using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)">Vulkan Api.</a>
<br />
<br />

The current codebase features: <br />
- Complete custom allocators for RAM and VRAM memory and memory pools.<br />
- Complete obj parser for 3d meshes loading<br />
- Embeded glsl compiler for shaders, possible to add shader recompilation at runtime<br />
- SPIRV generation <br />
- Custom code to load vulkan and initialize everything <br />
- Own custom math library and types<br />
- Embeded Glfw library <br />
- Uniform build script via Makefile <br />
- No external dependencies <br />
- Cross platform, Linux & Windows <br />
- 2d texture loader for png textures <br />
- Complete & saturated triangle list pipeline <br />
<br><br>

<span id="SDL-projects" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/SDL-projects">SDL-projects</a><br>
===============</span><br>
My projects using <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> graphics library. <br />
<br />

There are currently 2 projects: <br />
/Ether directory contains a simple setup code, and the idea behind it was <br />
to just learn to draw lines. It draws different shapes and matterns based <br />
on the window size, and the line reflects every lime it hits a corner of the <br />
window. <br />
<br />
/Standalone contains entire SDL library with my own custom Makefile. <br />
Only tested under Windows OS and proven to work. This project does character/font <br />
rendering from texture atlas and has complete ability to rotate, scale and animate characters. <br />
More information in the Readme file. <br />
<br />
This repository might expand in the future, as I get more ideas to implement. <br />
<br><br>

<span id="FA-Binary-Patches" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/FA-Binary-Patches">FA-Binary-Patches</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Binary patches for the engine of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander:_Forged_Alliance">SUPCOM</a>.<br />
<br />

It follows a long story, but unfortunately this legendary<br />
game has its game engine closed sourced and unavailable.<br />
Because I love this game, I have made binary patches to address<br />
common bugs with the engine and add some features to it.<br />
Everything had to be done in x86 assembly and with no source code,
basically a blind reverse engineering.<br />
<br />
Current Patches available: <br />
- Support for shared army mod, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;which allows multiple players to control 1 army at the same time.<br />
- Added extra category for units to be able to get selected while being built. <br />
- Units with 'WALL' category are now all selectable with double click<br />
- Fixed crash when entity is destroyed but attack order, or move is still in que <br />
- Removed double render of range rings, which improved rendering of unit range <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rings by + 10 FPS in certain scenarios. <br />
- Removed hard-coded no-rush timer and made it flexible to any value <br />
- Fixed replay desyncronization issues when a player leaves the game while other <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;players give unit commands, I reverse engineered the network protocol and wrote robust <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;algoritm to block any commands at that precious moment. (Really difficult patch to implement, lots <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of time went into this) <br />
- Removed some code in many places with the goal to improve performance  <br />
<br />
So you would ask me why? This is how I was able to master my  <br />
reverse engineering & assembly skills while bringing good <br />
things to 40K+ players community while doing nearly hacks on the edge of impossible.<br />
<br><br>

<span id="FA_Patcher" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/FA_Patcher">FA_Patcher</a><br>
===============</span><br>
My patcher for .exe files. Windows PE only.<br />
<br />

This project powers and enables me to edit assembly code of <br />
Windows executable files. This is a tricky and not easy process, <br />
it requires memory allocations, code relocations, assembly hooks<br />
and understanding of PE format on Windows OS.<br />
I have been working on it over the year long term constantly improving <br />
and adding new features. <br />
<br />
Features: <br />
- Creation of extra sections on EXE of any size. <br />
- Complete remote assembler implementation (asmjit) <br /> 
- Jit asm parser (asmtk) <br />
- Self packing technique which packages ASCII files for patch destribution <br />
- pelib implementation to do EXE specific edits, for instance PE header <br />
- Parser for raw assembly conversion to GCC style <br />
- Sections created by patcher can have C code loaded onto them <br />
<br />
Objective: <br />
This is a unitility program designed for those who know what they are doing.<br />
In order to properly use it and create own patches one has to know asm and C, <br />
but otherwise one can run already implemented patches right out of the box. <br />
<br><br>

<span id="Eng-Learn" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Eng-Learn">Eng-Learn</a><br>
===============</span><br>
A simple gui program.<br />
<br />

Using c++ library called WxWidgets the project aims to create a quizlet <br />
program where one can create a database of words and quiz self. It has complete UTF-8 <br />
support and a non repeating randomizer. <br />
<br />

<span id="N-pwr-R" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/N-pwr-R-permutation-lister">N-pwr-R</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Lists and outputs all n^r permutations.<br />
<br />

This program was created in order to aid cracking some simple lock combinations <br />
were one would need to keep track of combinations that were already used in a file. <br />
Until the brute force is successful. <br />
<br />

<span id="Pi-Endeavors" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Rasberry-Pi-Endeavors">Pi-Endeavors</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Drive WS2811 ledstrip with raspberry pi.<br />
<br />

Using the driver library this allows to control the addressable ledstrip <br />
and do anything with it. This involved figuring out how gpio pins work on this device.<br />
One thing that I left unsolved was the ability to read analog signals, with variable voltage. <br />
<br />

<span id="fa" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/fa">fa</a><br>
===============</span><br>
My fork of fa lua scripts for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander:_Forged_Alliance">SUPCOM</a><br />
<br />

The reason this is important and I've decided to list here is because that was one of my first <br />
real looks into the code, and open source contributions. I've added some ui changes and bug fixes to the <br />
main repository. Experience counts. And most importantly this taught me how to use git. <br />
<br />

<span id="Arduino-Projects" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Arduino-Projects">Arduino-Projects</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Arduino.<br />
<br />

My very first programs were written for arduino, that is where I started.<br />
There are many things in the repository, from simple buttons inputs to wifi controlled <br />
led stripes, moisture, light, ping, motion sensors, LCD screens and more. And of course an actual <br />
circuits had to be built to make this work.<br />
<br />

<span id="Atelerix-Engine" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Atelerix-Engine">Atelerix-Engine</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Experiment to write a game engine.<br />
<br />

Me and my friend wanted to write a game engine from scratch, however it run into <br />
many issues with portability and at last my friend game up on it, so did I. I keep this repository around <br />
however because it taught me some interesting concepts. Also it used sfml library for graphics, which <br />
I do not really like, but if I ever need it, there will be something to look at. <br />
<br />

<span id="SigFigures-Calc" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/SigFigures-Calculator-">SigFigures-Calc</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Basic but complex calculator.<br />
<br />

This was a project for Ap computer science class, and the objective was to write <br />
a significant figures calculator using just javascipt syntax, no api was allowed.<br />
It took 1000 lines of code and just pure parsing/algorithms. Giving the complex rules of <br />
significant figures and the limitations of my knowledge of javascript this became rather complex <br />
code, although it did meet it's requirements in the end. <br />
<br />

<span id="ArthasModPack" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Arthas-ModPack-FAF">ArthasModPack</a><br>
===============</span><br>
My collection of mods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Commander:_Forged_Alliance">SUPCOM</a><br />
<br />

I've tried to collect the best mods for the game in one place. A lot of them had to be rescriped and <br />
remade to work under different from original version of the game codebase. Although currently unmaintained<br />
it does feture some unique mods that nobody knows about. I've spent a lot of free time on this.<br />
<br />

<span id="MASM-Projects" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/MASM-Projects">MASM-Projects</a><br>
===============</span><br>
What I've done with microsoft assembler.<br />
<br />

Me learning graphics programming and assembly at the same time. <br />
I have used old direct X libraries 8 & 9 to render simple scenes like textured cube. <br />
Doing this at such a low level gave me a lot of insight on how processors work. <br />
However at some point it became very difficult to work with as complexity rised. <br />
<br />

<span id="Cell-Game-LD40" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Cell-Game-LD40">Cell-Game-LD40</a><br>
===============</span><br>
Game made for the jam.<br />
<br />

Me and my friend participated in even called Ludum Dare, where <br />
people compete to make a full indie game in 48 hours. Based on the theme we <br />
made a game that is similar to agar.io using unity game engine and C-sharp scripting. <br />
The game got 15 upvotes, which is not too bad. But needed to get 20 to be the contestant. <br />
Nonetheless can't take that away from me. <br />
<br />

<span id="My-Website" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/My-Website">My-Website</a><br>
===============</span><br>
This website.<br />
<br />

Despite this being simple site, the fonts and css sheets for this can be found with help <br />
of link above. <br />
<br />

<span id="Uni-Labs" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/Uni-Labs">Uni-Labs</a><br>
===============</span><br>
All my work and assignments for University C programming course.<br />
<br />

There is nothing special about this. Just a way for me to be organized. <br>
Tasks are usually quite trivial and mostly have to do with parsing something or <br>
creating a certain output to the console. This may change in the future though. <br>
<br />

<span id="Klec" class="heading"><a href="https://github.com/kyx0r/klec">Klec</a><br>
===============</span><br>
This repo consists of my personal linux dotfiles, configs <br />
and various scripts that I use or needed to have backed up. <br />
<br />
I also maintain my personal versions/forks of different C <br />
programs such as my own window manager for X11, terminal<br />
emulator, text editor, onscreen keyboard, filemanager,<br />
webbrowser, etc.<br />
Some of these programs are heavily modified in the process<br />
of me needing more features. All changes are mentioned in <br />
the readme.<br />
