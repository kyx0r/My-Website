<SPAN CLASS="BlueColor">Personal:</SPAN> <br />
I have been doing programming for the last 2 years, most of which includes personal projects. <br />
It has been my dream for those last years to become software engineer and I am working hard towards that. <br />
I stepped on the path of science long before I knew my destination, so meanwhile when I was still searching <br />
for my major I was able to gain variety of other skills including electrical circuit designs, automotive industry <br />
and physics on my own time. My areas of interest lie in graphics programming and low level systems, as my <br />
passion has always been inspired by knowing how a system actually works. <br />
I focus on minimalism in life. Less is more is what makes up my brain.<br />
Currently preoccupied with higher education. <br /> <br />
